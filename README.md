# Etsy Seller SEO System

A free, evidence-driven **Etsy SEO tool** for AI assistants. It optimizes Etsy listings — titles, all 13 tags, attributes, and descriptions — using live Etsy autocomplete research, top-10 competitor SERP analysis, and current 2026 Etsy policy checks. Runs inside Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini on free tiers, with no shop registration, setup forms, or API keys.

**Quick start:** paste [`portable/Etsy_Listing_System_Instructions.md`](./portable/Etsy_Listing_System_Instructions.md) into any AI chat as your first message, then send your listing. Installing the Claude skill takes three commands — see [Installation](#installation).

## Features

Everything below is built for Etsy SEO in 2026 — Etsy titles, Etsy tags, attributes, and descriptions.

### Caveman Output Mode

Crisp, bullet-first output that reduces token usage by up to 70%. Full raw SERP breakdowns and keyword tracking stay in state and unlock on demand (`"expand"`, `"full report"`).

### Five Immutable System Laws

Non-bypassable execution discipline (`skill/references/playbooks/system-laws.md`):

1. **Zero state skips** — sequential workflows with difficulty assessment and output phases.
2. **Zero hallucination** — live search data, or explicit `[Data Source: Reasoning Engine Fallback]` tagging.
3. **Strict listing rules** — exactly 13 tags, each 20 characters or fewer, with at most 2 tags per phrase cluster.
4. **Caveman output protocol** — concise by default, details on request.
5. **Strict format mandate** — mandatory title formula, title word count, no-emoji rule, and Etsy 2026 AI disclosure.

### Live Research Engine

- **Real Etsy autocomplete** — what buyers are typing right now.
- **Top 10 competitor SERP scraping** — what is winning for a given keyword.
- **Competition difficulty assessment** — whether a keyword is realistic or saturated.

### Optimized Etsy Titles, Tags, and Descriptions

- Mandatory title formula `[Primary Keyword] [Style Descriptor] | [Format]` within the first 40 characters, with a mobile preview line.
- A 6–12 word title limit (maximum 14), plus a prohibited subjective-words stoplist (`cute`, `beautiful`, and similar).
- All 13 tags verified at 20 characters or fewer, with phrase-overlap rules enforced.
- No emojis in description text or section headers — clean formatting and screen-reader accessibility.
- NLP-aware natural-language writing, with no keyword chains, which Etsy's 2026 algorithm penalizes.

### Trademark and Policy Guard

- Flags trademarked words before a listing is taken down.
- Checks Etsy's current 2026 policies each session through the automated dual-repo policy sync engine (`skill/scripts/sync_etsy_policy.py`).
- Platform fit check on saturated niches (over 100K results) before a listing is built.

### Honest Scope Diagnosis

- Identifies when the problem is not SEO, and what it actually is.
- Action-layer pointers with competitor data, price ranges, and free-tool recommendations.
- Diff view for rewrites, showing exactly what changed and why.

### Pinterest Content

- Generates Pinterest marketing content with explicit 220–232 character counts and adjust guidance.

### Cross-Session Memory

- Remembers listings across sessions on Claude, avoiding duplicate keyword suggestions.
- Silent local database at `~/etsy-listings/` for the keyword map, refresh schedule, and listing state.
- Keyword reuse warnings with sibling-phrase suggestions.

---

## Scope and Limits

This system does not:

- Claim an SEO rewrite will fix a hero-image problem.
- Claim a tag rewrite will rescue a listing with a 0.3% conversion rate.
- Promise a #1 ranking.
- Create images, videos, or mockups (it writes briefs only).

When the problem is not SEO, it says so and points to concrete next steps backed by real data.

This is an Etsy SEO tool, and it does Etsy SEO well. If Etsy SEO is the only problem, expect a meaningful traffic lift — typically 20–40% impression improvement on rewritten listings within 30 days. If the problem lies elsewhere (weak photos, pricing, reviews, or a saturated niche), the system will say so and route you to what would actually work.

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Claude / Cowork (full automation, recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moiz-za/etsy-seller-seo-system.git
cd etsy-seller-seo-system
cp -r skill ~/.claude/skills/etsy-seller
```

Restart Claude. On the first listing input, the skill creates `~/etsy-listings/` and begins tracking. No file management is required.

### Option 2: ChatGPT / Perplexity / Gemini

Upload `portable/Etsy_Listing_System_Instructions.md` as a knowledge file to your Custom GPT, Space, or Gem, and enable web browsing.

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for detailed steps per tool.

## How It Works

```
Paste listing (title + tags + description)  or  short new-product description
                    │
                    ▼
          Auto-Detect: REWRITE vs CREATE
                    │          (no mode selection, no prompts)
                    ▼
        Live Research — Etsy autocomplete
        + top-10 competitor SERP scraping
                    │
                    ▼
    Competition Difficulty Assessment
    + Trademark / Policy Check (stoplist + 2026 policies)
                    │
                    ▼
      Listing Build: title → 13 tags → attributes
      → description → Pinterest block → pre-publish checklist
                    │
                    ▼
   Caveman-mode output + diff view (rewrites) + state saved
   to ~/etsy-listings/
```

That is the whole interaction: no mode selection, no shop prompts, no setup forms.

## Free vs Paid

Most paid Etsy SEO tools cost $9–$50 per month. This system is designed to run entirely on free tiers.

### The free path

1. Sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com), or [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com).
2. Open [`portable/Etsy_Listing_System_Instructions.md`](./portable/Etsy_Listing_System_Instructions.md) and copy the entire contents.
3. Start a new chat and paste the document as your first message.
4. Reply with: *"OK, follow this system. Here's my listing: [paste your listing]"*.

### Free-tier support

| Tool | Free tier works? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude.ai (free)** | Yes | Daily message cap; web search enabled. Paste the portable doc as the first message. |
| **ChatGPT (free)** | Yes | Browsing available on the free tier. Same paste-first-message pattern. |
| **Gemini (free)** | Yes | Web search available; handles long instructions well. |
| **Perplexity (free)** | Partial | Basic search works, but the URL-fetch dependency in keyword research is less reliable on the free tier. |

### What the free path keeps

- All SEO rules (title, tags, attributes, description).
- Live Etsy autocomplete and competitor SERP research (with web browsing enabled).
- Trademark stoplist scan.
- Honest scope diagnosis.
- Per-intent description hooks, indexing spread check, Pinterest content, and the pre-publish checklist.
- All operational playbooks.

### What the free path gives up

- **Cross-session memory** — re-paste the session-state snapshot at the start of each new chat (about 30 seconds).
- **Automatic folder management** — no local `~/etsy-listings/` database; state lives in the chat thread.
- **Daily message limits** — free tiers cap daily usage.

### When the paid path makes sense

For 30+ listings or multiple shops, the paid Claude path removes manual copy-paste friction:

- **Claude Code** (terminal) — requires Claude Pro/Max or API credits.
- **Cowork** (Claude desktop app) — requires Claude Pro/Max.

Copy the `skill/` folder to `~/.claude/skills/etsy-seller/` and the system handles state automatically.

The skill content is identical on both paths. For 1–5 listings, the free path is sufficient.

| Diagnostics | Prescriptive tag advice | Identifies when the problem is not SEO |
| State across sessions | None or paid SaaS | Local markdown files |
| Cost | $9–$50/month | $0, runs inside your AI tool |

## FAQ

**Is there a free path?**
Yes. Paste `portable/Etsy_Listing_System_Instructions.md` into any free-tier chat (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini). All SEO rules, live research (with web browsing), trademark scanning, and scope diagnosis are included. See [Free vs Paid](#free-vs-paid).

**Do I need API keys or a paid SaaS account?**
No. The system runs inside your AI tool — no API keys, subscriptions, or hosted service.

**How do I rewrite an existing listing?**
Paste the current title, all 13 tags, and the full description. The system detects a rewrite, runs the research, and returns an optimized version with a diff view.

**How do I create a new listing?**
Describe the product briefly, for example: *"Funny cat mom SVG bundle, 20 designs, SVG/PNG/EPS, commercial use included."* The system detects a new listing and builds it from scratch.

**Does it work on free tiers?**
Claude.ai, ChatGPT, and Gemini work on free tiers. Perplexity works partially; the URL-fetch dependency in keyword research is less reliable there.

**How does cross-session memory work on the free path?**
Re-paste the session-state snapshot at the start of each new chat (about 30 seconds). On paid Claude, this is automatic via `~/etsy-listings/`.

**What if my problem is not SEO?**
The system says so and points to concrete next steps, rather than rewriting tags that will not help.

**Can I use it for multiple shops?**
Yes. Use a separate chat thread per shop; each thread is its own database.

**Is this affiliated with Etsy?**
No. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Etsy, Inc.
